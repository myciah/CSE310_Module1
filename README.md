# Overview

This project was a hands-on way for me to get more comfortable with C++ and build something functional from start to finish. I wanted to practice structuring a program with classes, functions, file input/output, and control flow, while keeping the code organized and readable.

The software itself is a simple console-based To-Do List Manager. It lets users view tasks, add new ones, remove tasks, mark them as complete, and save everything to a file. When you reopen the program, it loads your saved tasks automatically, so your progress persists across sessions.

Building this project helped me dive deeper into key C++ concepts like object-oriented design, vectors, loops, conditional statements, and file handling. It also gave me practice breaking a program into logical sections and writing code that’s easy to understand and maintain.

# Development Environment

I built this project in **Visual Studio Code**, and I used **Git and GitHub** for version control and publishing. The program was compiled and tested on a **Windows** machine with a standard C++ compiler.

The project uses **C++** and relies on standard libraries, including:

- `<iostream>` for input and output  
- `<vector>` for storing tasks dynamically  
- `<string>` for handling text  
- `<fstream>` for reading and writing files

# Useful Websites

While working on this project, these sites were really helpful:

- [cplusplus.com](https://www.cplusplus.com/) – great for syntax reference and examples  
- [GeeksforGeeks - C++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/) – useful tutorials and explanations

# AI Disclosure

I used AI tools, specifically **ChatGPT**, as a learning and reference aid to help me understand C++ concepts and syntax. AI helped clarify certain programming ideas, explore example code, and provide guidance on structuring the program.  

Specifically, AI helped me:

- Understand how to define classes and member functions  
- Explore handling user input, loops, and conditionals  
- Learn how to read from and write to files for task persistence  

The AI-generated examples gave me a starting point, but I studied everything carefully to understand how it worked. I made sure I could explain and run every part of the code on my own.  

Through this project, I learned:

- How to use classes to organize data and behavior  
- How vectors and file streams work in practice  
- How loops and conditionals control program flow  
- How to build a simple console application with persistent data  

In short, AI was used as a **supplemental learning tool**, and this project reflects both the guidance I received and my own understanding and experimentation.

# Future Work

Here are a few ideas I’d like to explore if I continue developing this project:

- Add a search feature to quickly find tasks by keyword  
- Improve the menu interface by adding a clear screen option  
- Upgrade to a graphical user interface (GUI) instead of the console
