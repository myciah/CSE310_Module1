# Overview

The goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of C++ fundamentals by building a complete, functional console application from start to finish. I wanted to practice structuring a program using classes, functions, file input/output, and control flow while maintaining clean and readable code.

The software is a console-based To-Do List Manager written in C++. It allows users to view tasks, add new tasks, remove tasks, mark tasks as complete, and save their progress to a file. When the program is restarted, previously saved tasks are automatically loaded, demonstrating persistent data storage.

I wrote this software to deepen my understanding of C++ syntax and core programming concepts such as object-oriented design, vectors, conditional logic, loops, and file handling. This project also helped me become more comfortable breaking a program into logical sections and writing code that is easy to maintain and explain.

# Development Environment

This project was developed using Visual Studio Code as the primary code editor. Git and GitHub were used for version control and to publish the project publicly. The program was compiled and tested using a C++ compiler in a Windows environment.

The programming language used for this project is C++. Standard libraries were used, including:
- `<iostream>` for input and output
- `<vector>` for dynamic task storage
- `<string>` for handling text
- `<fstream>` for reading from and writing to files

# Future Work

- Add a search feature to find tasks by keyword
- Add a clear screen feature to improve menu readability
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) instead of using the console
