# Overview

The goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of C++ fundamentals by building a complete, functional console application from start to finish. I wanted to practice structuring a program using classes, functions, file input/output, and control flow while maintaining clean and readable code.

The software is a console-based To-Do List Manager written in C++. It allows users to view tasks, add new tasks, remove tasks, mark tasks as complete, and save their progress to a file. When the program is restarted, previously saved tasks are automatically loaded, demonstrating persistent data storage.

I wrote this software to deepen my understanding of C++ syntax and core programming concepts such as object-oriented design, vectors, conditional logic, loops, and file handling. This project also helped me become more comfortable breaking a program into logical sections and writing code that is easy to maintain and explain.

# Development Environment

This project was developed using Visual Studio Code as the primary code editor. Git and GitHub were used for version control and to publish the project publicly. The program was compiled and tested using a C++ compiler in a Windows environment.

The programming language used for this project is C++. Standard libraries were used, including:
- `<iostream>` for input and output
- `<vector>` for dynamic task storage
- `<string>` for handling text
- `<fstream>` for reading from and writing to files

# AI Disclosure

For this project, I used AI tools, specifically ChatGPT, as a **learning and reference aid** to support my understanding of C++ and programming concepts. AI was used to help clarify syntax, explore example code, and provide guidance on structuring the program, but the code itself was generated with the assistance of AI.

High-level uses of AI included:
- Understanding how to define classes and member functions in C++
- Exploring ways to handle user input, loops, and conditionals
- Learning how to read from and write to files for task persistence

AI guidance was primarily used to **generate initial code structure and examples**, which I studied to better understand C++ language features and program organization. While the AI-generated code formed the base of the project, I engaged with it to learn from the examples, observed how the language constructs worked, and explored how the program behaves when running.

Through this process, I learned:
- How a class can encapsulate data and behavior
- How to use vectors and file streams effectively
- How conditional statements and loops control program flow
- How a simple console application can maintain persistent data

In summary, AI was used as a **supplemental learning tool** to understand C++ programming concepts. The project reflects the code generated with AI support and my engagement with the language and software development concepts while exploring how it works.

# Future Work

- Add a search feature to find tasks by keyword
- Add a clear screen feature to improve menu readability
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) instead of using the console
